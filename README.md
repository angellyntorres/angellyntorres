## Hi there!
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at the Department of Finance as a Technical Assistant. I am at the forefront of policymaking by conducting technical reviews of research outputs provided by the Fiscal Policy and Monitoring Group, Tax Research and Expenditure Monitoring, Political and Legislative Liaison Group, National Tax Research Center, and the Office of the Chief Economist.
ðŸŒ± I have recently graduated from the University of the Philippines Diliman as a Magna Cum Laude with a Bachelor of Science degree in Economics.
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on topics involving migration, gender, Artificial Intelligence, and governance.
